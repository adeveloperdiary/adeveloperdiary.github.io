## Problem

Given the `head` of a linked list, return *the list after sorting it in **ascending order***.

**Example 1:**

<img src="../assets/img/sort_list_1.jpeg" alt="addtwonumber1" style="zoom:67%;" />

```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

<img src="../assets/img/sort_list_2.jpeg" alt="reverse_ex2" style="zoom:67%;" />

```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

## Solution



## Final Code

Here is the full code.

```python

```

## Runtime Complexity

The runtime will be `O(n)` as we are simply scanning through the list once.
