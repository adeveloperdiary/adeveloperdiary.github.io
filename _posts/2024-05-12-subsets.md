## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *all possible* *subsets*  *(the power set)*.

The solution set **must not** contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]
```

## Solution

This is one of the classic backtracking algorithm. For every `index` location, we need to run `dfs()` twice. One using the element and another time is not using the element. Let's look at the graph below.

![subset](../assets/img/subset.jpg)

Start by defining the variables. We need two of them, one for returning the final `output` and another one for saving the `subset`. 

```python
output = []
subset = []
```

Next the most important part is to identify the terminating condition, that is when to add the current `subset` to the `output` array. Whenever we reach the end of the tree, that is the `index` is equal to the `len(nums)` we know that we have reached a leaf and now need to add the `subset` to the `output`.

```python 
def dfs(index):
  if index >= len(nums):
    output.append(subset.copy())
    return
```

Now the recursive calls.

```python
  subset.append(nums[index])
  dfs(index + 1)

  subset.pop()
  dfs(index + 1)
```

Now call the `dfs()` by passing `index` as `0` and return the `output`.

```python
dfs(0)
return output
```

### Reverse Way!

Can you now implement the reverser way? So instead of adding the `nums[index]` value to the `subset` and popping it later. Start without the `subset.append(nums[index])` and add it in the second choice. Below is the code:

```python 
	...
	
  # Call dfs() without appending the nums[i]
	dfs(index + 1)
  	
  # now add it and call dfs()
  subset.append(nums[index])
  dfs(index + 1)
	
  # before returning still need to pop it.
  subset.pop()

```

## Final Code

Here is the full code.

```python
def subsets(nums):
    output = []
    subset = []

    def dfs(index):
        if index >= len(nums):
            output.append(subset.copy())
            return

        subset.append(nums[index])
        dfs(index + 1)

        subset.pop()
        dfs(index + 1)

    dfs(0)
    return output
```
