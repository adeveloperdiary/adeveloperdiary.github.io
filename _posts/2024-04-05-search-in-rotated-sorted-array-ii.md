## Problem

There is an integer array **nums** sorted in **non-decreasing order** (not necessarily with distinct values). Given the array **nums** after the **rotation** and an integer **target**, return **true** if **target** is in **nums**, or **false** if it is not in **nums**.

### Example 1:

- **Input** :  nums = `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`, target = `0`    	
- **Output** : `True`

## Solution

- Very similar to the previous problem. [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](two-pointers/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

- The main complexity is we **canâ€™t run** binary search if  `nums[l] == nums[m]`. This this case just move the **left** pointer to right by **one step**.

- We can use the same 3 conditions from previous problem. However here we will use just different variation as both are valid. 
  - Just one major difference is since now `nums[l]` and `nums[r]` can be same, we will use `<=` instead of just using `>` or `<`.

Its very important to understand the above 4 diagrams.  They shows the logic on how to move `l` and `r` pointers.

##  Code

```python
def rotated_search(nums, target):
    l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2

        # Return if target is found
        if target == nums[mid]:
            return mid

        # If left is smaller than middle then
        # left of the middle is sorted.
        if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
            # there are three loctions where
            # the trget could be present.
            # We need to check for all three

            if target > nums[mid]:
                # 1. Target is right of middle and
                # in the same partition
                # In this case move left to mid +1
                l = mid + 1
            elif target < nums[l]:
                # 2. target is in the right partition
                # In this case move the left to mid+1
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                # 3. Target is left of middle in the same
                # sorted partition
                # In this case move right to mid-1
                r = mid - 1
        else:
            # The right of the middle is sorted.
            # Again check for three conditions.
            if target < nums[mid]:
                # 1. Target is in the left of the
                # middle and in same partition
                # In this case move right to mid-1
                r = mid - 1
            elif target > nums[r]:
                # 2. Target is in the other partition
                # In this case move right to mid-1
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                # 3. Target is right of middle in the
                # same sorted partition
                # In this case move left to mid+1
                l = mid + 1

    return -1
  print(rotated_search([4,5,6,7,0,1,2],0))
```

## Runtime Complexity

The runtime will be `O(log n)` as we are simply running a binary search.
