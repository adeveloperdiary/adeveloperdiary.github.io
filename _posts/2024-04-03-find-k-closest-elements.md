## Problem

Given a sorted integer array **arr**, two integers **k** and **x**, return the **k** closest integers to **x** in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If **distance** of two integers are **same** from **x**, then choose the **smaller** one. **x** may **not** be present in the array arr.
