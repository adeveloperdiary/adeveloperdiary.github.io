## Problem

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

**Example 1:**

<img src="../assets/img/swap_ex1.jpeg" alt="addtwonumber1" style="zoom:67%;" />

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

## Solution

## Final Code

Here is the full code.

```python

```

## Runtime Complexity

The runtime will be `O(n)` as we are simply scanning through the list once.
