## Why another algorithm tutorial ?

Numerous implementations of popular algorithms abound across various online platforms and blogs. While these resources serve their purpose well, my intention is not to supplant them. Rather, I recognize that for novice programmers, comprehension often comes more readily through visual aids such as videos rather than through traditional written materials.

While existing resources excel at teaching algorithms, few focus on techniques for long-term retention and efficient recall. Additionally, the ability to confidently discern problem-solving patterns is crucial. My aim is not to overwhelm with a plethora of algorithms, but rather to provide concise notes and visual aids for key algorithms, facilitating rapid review.
